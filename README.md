<h1>TravelMate</h1>
TravelMate is a full-stack, responsive MERN web application meticulously crafted with modern technologies, including React Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and TypeScript. As the Tech Lead of this project, I guided the team using Agile development methodologies, ensuring efficient and timely delivery of features.

TravelMate leverages 12+ RESTful APIs to gather and display real-time data on hotels, flights, countries, and more, providing users with up-to-date information. The application integrates Socket.io to enable real-time collaboration, allowing users to create and manage trips together seamlessly.

Security and scalability were top priorities. The project implements OAuth with Passport.js and JWT for secure authentication and session management. It also includes comprehensive unit and integration test coverage on both the server and client, ensuring reliability and stability across the platform.

The application was fully Dockerized and deployed to Google Cloud Run, taking advantage of serverless architecture for cost-effective scalability and maintenance.

This project exemplifies my leadership and technical skills, showcasing my ability to deliver robust, real-time, data-driven applications in a collaborative and dynamic environment.
